        You may be led to therapy by anxiety, depression, relationship stress, past or recent trauma, grief and loss,
        self-esteem issues,
        <br /> or challenges with family, parenting, or parental relationships. Whatever the source of
        your stress, you don&apos;t have to face it <br /> alone. Therapy offers you the time and space to work toward wellness
        and peace.

            The care you provide for others may be driving you to seek <br /> therapy, whether due to burnout, compassion fatigue,
            <br /> imposter syndrome, people-pleasing tendencies, or <br />perfectionism. Whether you&apos;re in pre-professional school,
            <br /> undergoing training, or reflecting on a long career in <br /> healthcare, we can address the unique stressors of your <br />professional environment along with any challenges you <br />may be facing in other areas of your life.

            <br /> Life&apos;s challenges, whether a difficult childhood, a traumatic <br /> event or series of events, or the loss of someone or <br />something deeply meaningful, can lead to profound <br />experiences of trauma and grief. Therapy offers a supportive <br />space to process these experiences, care for yourself amidst <br />painful thoughts and emotions, and work toward a sense of
            grounding and meaning.

            <br /> Second-generation individuals in immigrant families, born in <br /> the U.S. to at least one parent born abroad, often navigate <br />the complexities of multiple cultures and diverse <br />expectations. This experience can bring challenges such as <br />feeling like a foreigner in your own country and navigating <br />strained family relationships. Therapy offers a supportive <br /> space to explore and process this unique aspect of your <br />identity.
